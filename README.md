# pct-hub-frontend-prototype

This project is only a prototype - this is not a live service.

This repo is a playground to test code, fomratting, layouts and to use in User Research. There is a likelihood this repo will be the building blocks for the live service.

At present the plan is to build our formatting and style from an existing service - https://gds-way.cloudapps.digital/
