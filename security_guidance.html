            <p>Considering the guidance from the security pillar of the Well Architected Framework, we have different
              sections that relate to security in the Home Office:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Cloud responsibility model</li>
              <li>Long lived access keys</li>
              <li>How IAM works in the HO</li>
              <li>National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) Cloud Security Principles</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="cloud_responsibility_model">Cloud responsibility model</h2>
            <h3>What is the cloud responsibility model?</h3>
            <p>Cloud Security is fundamentally based on what the major public cloud providers term as shared
              responsibility model (SRM) between customers and the cloud provider. All organisations using the cloud
              sign up to this model. The SRM defines who is responsible for what on the cloud. The model broadly divides
              responsibilities into "of" and "in". The Home Office has responsibility for the security in the cloud,
              this covers how we use the cloud. While the cloud provider has responsibility for the security of the
              cloud. The details of this model depend significantly on the type of service that you are using in the
              cloud, for example the Home Office has less responsibility over an Azure Function (the equivalent of AWS
              lambda) which is serverless compared to an AWS EC2 where everything accept the physical hardware, boot and
              storage is our responsibility.</p>

            <h3>Cloud Services</h3>
            <p>Cloud services can be generally split between Infrastructure, Platform or Software as a service.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) are services provided within the cloud means that the Home Office
                operates the infrastructure but do not control the physical infrastructure.</li>
              <li>Platform as a Service or Container Services (PaaS/CS) (Azure/AWS) are cloud provided services where
                the customer has fewer responsibilities to secure the service and AWS/Azure have greater responsibility
                for keeping services up to date. Cloud providers are responsible for the platform and application
                management as well as the security of the operating systems and networks (except for Firewall
                configuration, i.e. security groups which can be configured by the customer to lock down access to the
                service).</li>
              <li>Software as a Service or Abstract Services (SaaS/AS) (Azure/AWS) are cloud provided services where the
                customer has the fewest responsibilities to secure the service. The cloud provider is responsible for
                the security of network, platform, OS and infrastructure. The Home Office are responsible for managing
                who has access to the data and that we are using the encryption services. These responsibilities are
                split over several Home Office teams.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The functions within the model can be broken down to the following:</p>

                    the portfolio using the cloud, however, other teams such as CSOC, platforms, public cloud, networks

            <h3>Cloud Providers and Home Office Responsibility Model</h3>
            <p>The responsibility model split between the Cloud Provider and the Home Office is shown in the diagram
              below. This has been genericised across the IaaS/PaaS/SaaS type services, where the more purple equals
              more responsibility that the Home Office takes over the service (i.e. for a Operations HO would have
              responsibilities for IaaS and PaaS components but the Cloud Provider would have the same for SaaS).</p>

            <h3>What does this mean in practice to the Home Office, and where do the responsibilities sit within the
              Home Office organisation structure?</h3>
            <p>The answer depends on where in Digital, Data and Technology the AWS account sits. Under the model, the
              Home Office has adopted this aligns to the division of the Home Office AWS estate into three Organizations
              (BICS-EBSA, Policing and Central). Note that the Public Cloud Team will remain responsible for billing
              across all accounts, although we will not retain root account responsibilities for Policing. This has an
              impact on cyber security risk management and where controls are put in place across the organisation.</p>

            <p>The responsibility matrix can also be expanded to other areas of processes and standards across the HO
              organisation and diagram below shows a generic responsibility model across Central teams (i.e. Enterprise
              Services teams), Platforms (i.e. EBSA, ACP, LECP), Portfolios (i.e. BICS, PPPT) and HO capabilities such
              as CSOC/ITOC and OCISO. It is noted that individual areas will have a slightly different split of
              responsibilities and this should be outlined within security and service wrappers.</p>

            <h3>What does the above mean for my project?</h3>
            <p>That depends on what service type you are using and where in the Home Office your project is. If you are
              using IaaS, i.e. you are running and managing your own EC2 instances to do something on your application,
              you will be responsible for significantly more security controls than if you are using a HO Platform such
              as EBSA or ACP. The key thing to remember is that although your project may not be directly responsible
              for the configuration and provision of cloud services you use from a data protection and cyber security
              perspective your Senior Responsible Owner will be taking risks that are mitigated by actions of other
              teams.</p>

            <h2 id="access_keys">Access Keys</h2>
            <p>This guidance has been designed to help development and operational teams using AWS to avoid using
              long-lived access keys and use temporary credentials instead (via the Secure Token Service).</p>
            <p><b>Note:</b> An alternative is to ensure the long-lived access keys are rotated regularly (i.e. within 90
              days of creation).</p>

            <h3>What is an access key?</h3>
            <p>An AWS access key are long-term credentials for an IAM user. Access keys consist of an id and secret
              which is similar to usernames and passwords. Access keys can be used to sign programmatic requests to the
              AWS CLI or AWS API (directly or using the AWS SDK).</p>

            <h3>Access keys in the Home Office</h3>
            <p>The Home Office as of May 2020 has over 1400 active AWS access keys which had not been rotated within 90
              days, of which over 350 (25%) have not been rotated in over two years. Static credentials pose a security
              and compliance risk as it means they can be used on an ongoing basis if they have been lost, stolen,
              cracked or published to a public repository. At present access keys are used by both users and
              applications / services.</p>

            <h3>Why is rotating access keys important?</h3>
            <p>The importance of AWS access keys and rotation of them can be seen through their inclusion in the <a
                href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/top-10-security-items-to-improve-in-your-aws-account/"
                target="_blank">AWS top 10 security items</a> to improve in your AWS account and <a
                href="https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/compliance/AWS_CIS_Foundations_Benchmark.pdf"
                target="_blank">CIS AWS Foundation Benchmark</a>.</p>

            <p>The Public Cloud Team encourage the use of more secure and robust access key policy for the Home Office
              to educate users, application and platform teams of best practice and to encourage good behaviours. In the
              future the PCT may if authorised by Home Office technical, data, governance and security fora enforce the
              use of best practice, however, the current model is <b>educate</b>, <b>detect</b>, <b>guide</b>.</p>

            <h3>Policy</h3>
            <p>The PCT are looking at implementing the following policy for access keys, to reduce the risks to the Home
              Office. We will not force business areas to comply with the policy. The policy will allow us to highlight
              where there are potential risks in the organisation.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>AWS access keys should not be used where there is a valid alternative available using temporary access
                keys</li>
              <li>AWS access keys must only be created where there is a clear requirement for programmatic access</li>
              <li>AWS access keys must be rotated at least every <b>90 days, if not more often</b>, either through the
                AWS Console, Command Line Interface (CLI), or Application Programming Interface (API). <a
                  href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html#Using_RotateAccessKey"
                  target="_blank">Instructions for rotating access keys</a></li>
              <li>Individual AWS access keys must not be shared internally or externally with any other user or
                organisation, that is not the intended recipient of the access key</li>
              <li>AWS access keys must be securely stored and approved as part of a service's security assurance</li>
              <li>AWS access keys must not be embedded directly into code or repositories, tools provided by the AWS SDK
                and command line tools (e.g. AWS credentials file) should be used instead. <a
                  href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_use-resources.html"
                  target="_blank">Further documentation for using temporary</a></li>
              <li>In the event an AWS access key is published to the internet (e.g. GitHub), shared or lost you should
                follow the relevant incident management process and notify <a
                  href="mailto:public.cloud@homeoffice.gov.uk">public.cloud@homeoffice.gov.uk</a> immediately. The
                access key should also be made inactive and deleted.</li>
              <li>Permissions for individual users, services or applications using AWS access keys should be limited,
                based on least privilege and regularly reviewed (administrative permissions should be given as a last
                resort)</li>
              <li>Multi Factor Authentication (MFA) must be enabled for any individual IAM user that has programmatic
                access and AWS access keys provided to them</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Rotating your Access Keys</h3>
            <p>Access keys have a high level of permission, do not require re-authentication or use of MFA and can be
              easily committed as code. Therefore, it is much better practice to rotate any access keys that you use on
              a regular basis (AWS recommend a maximum of 90 days). It is noted that AWS recommend using temporary
              security credentials through the STS service over using access keys at all.</p>
            <p>In order to rotate your access keys, you need to have permission. All Home Office users with HOFullAdmin
              role should have the correct permissions. If you do not, you can raise a request with the Public Cloud
              Team to update your permissions. AWS have produced <a
                href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html#Using_RotateAccessKey"
                target="_blank">step by step guidance for rotate access keys</a> using the Console, the CLI and the API
              to rotate any user access keys.</p>
            <p><a
                href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html#Using_RotateAccessKey"
                target="_blank">Amazon blog post for rotating access keys</a></p>

            <h3>Temporary Access Keys</h3>
            <p>At present the use of AWS access keys provide high levels of access with long lived credentials. However,
              in most cases long lived credentials are not required, and the access requirements can be fulfilled using
              short-lived temporary security credentials.</p>
            <p>Temporary security credentials are generated using the Security Token Service through the assumption of
              IAM roles. Along with an access key ID and secret access key, a security token is also created that
              indicates when the credentials expire. An example of the flow is provided below.</p>

            <img src="images/example_security_flow.png" style="border: solid" alt="example of the security flow">

            <p>The primary benefit of temporary access keys provided by STS is that it limits the potential blast radius
              of any security incident, as the credentials provided are short lived. This means if they are accidently
              shared, published or stolen they will soon time out without user intervention. Where it is required though
              temporary security credentials can be revoked as detailed. <a
                href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_revoke-sessions.html"
                target="_blank">How to revoke IAM role temporary security credentials</a></p>

            <h3>Amazon EC2</h3>
            <p>Where an application or AWS CLI script is running on an EC2 instance do not use access keys directly in
              the application. Instead define an IAM role that has the appropriate permissions for your application and
              attach it to the EC2 instance to be used. For applications using the AWS SDKs and CLI temporary
              credentials are retrieved from the role automatically. <a
                href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/iam-roles-for-amazon-ec2.html"
                target="_blank">IAM roles for EC2</a>.</p>

            <h3>AWS Lambda</h3>
            <p>Each Lambda function has an execution role created in IAM that provides the function with the necessary
              permissions to run. When using the AWS SDKs, the temporary credentials are automatically retrieved from
              the execution role. Long lived AWS access keys should not be used at all when using Lambda including
              providing them via the environmental variables. <a
                href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-intro-execution-role.html" target="_blank">AWS
                Lambda execution role</a>.</p>

            <h3>IAM USERS</h3>
            <p>The majority of IAM users do not require access keys that provide them with high levels of permissions,
              or multiple access keys to access multiple AWS accounts. Instead following best practice IAM users should
              be provided with a single AWS access key that provides a minimal level of access, this reduces the blast
              radius of long-lived access keys being published to the internet, shared or stolen as they will have
              restricted access. When users require privileged access, they should assume a role which will grant them
              temporary credentials as per figure 1. This can be used both within the same account that the IAM user
              exists in and to provide cross account access.</p>

            <h3>Future</h3>
            <p>The PCT are currently under educate, detect, guide model, where we are aiming to improve cloud practices
              across the Home Office by improving understanding of the cloud, being able to highlight when best
              practices are not being followed, and guiding our users.</p>
